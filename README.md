# Simple-neural-network
This code implements a simple neural network with 3 layers with the following speciâ€€cations: the input layer has 4 nodes the hidden layer has 6 nodes the output layer has 3 nodes all nodes in the hidden layer and output layer use sigmoid activation function all weights are initialised to 1 all bias values are initalised to 1
