# Simple-neural-network
This code implements a simple neural network with 3 layers with the following specifications: 
* The input layer has 4 nodes
* The hidden layer has 6 nodes
* The output layer has 3 nodes

All nodes in the hidden layer and output layer use sigmoid activation function all weights are initialised to 1 all bias values are initalised to 1.
